<p><strong>Asthma home remedies:</strong>&nbsp;Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disorder that affects the ability to breathe. Asthma patients are more likely to experience inflammation and tightness of the bronchi (airways) in their lungs. Reduced airflow results from the smooth muscles around the airways contracting and perhaps increased phlegm production in the lungs and pollution can contribute to these factors.</p>

<p>Some complementary therapies, in addition to inhalers and other medications, may aid in the management of asthma. These, however, should never take the place of any therapy that your healthcare provider has prescribed or advised.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are 5 best home remedies that can aid with your treatment,</p>

<p>Herbal teas like eucalyptus tea, liquorice tea, turmeric tea, and mullein tea may be able to treat asthma. Some people use them to alleviate coughs, sore throats, and other asthma-related symptoms, or to try and reduce mucus production.</p>

<h2>3. Essential oils</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While some people find that breathing specific essential oils with anti-inflammatory characteristics improves their health, others with asthma find that their symptoms go worse when they are exposed to the oils or any intense aroma.</p>
